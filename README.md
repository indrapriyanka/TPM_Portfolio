One great way to manage our projects more effectively is to create a graphical representation of the work that needs to get done. 
By doing so, we'll be able to surface problems and opportunities. 
We'll be able to spot any areas in which activities will be accidentally overlapping or where you can make adjustments to assignments to keep work moving ahead. 
Project Network also helps determine the possible start time and end time for each activity.
